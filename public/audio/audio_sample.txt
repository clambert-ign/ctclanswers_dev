[NARRATOR]: Transcripts in a snap.

[snap]

Think of a transcript as a
text version of your video.

When made correctly,

video transcripts can
be read by screen readers

or turned into Braille documents,

making your content accessible
to people who are blind or low vision.

If a video player doesn’t support captions,

a transcript can provide access

for people who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing.

They're also helpful for people who

want to quickly scan
or search a video’s content.

So what’s in a transcript?

A basic transcript

is just a written version
of everything said in your video.

It also indicates who says it,

and any relevant sounds.

To make our transcripts more accessible,

make sure to include

any key visual information
someone would need

in order to understand
what’s going on,

such as locations or
important nonverbal communication.

How else would someone
relying on a transcript know

that your characters were
waving from a train?

Many service providers will
transcribe your video for you

for less than a dollar a minute.

But if you’ve already done the work
to caption your video on youtube,

producing a video transcript
is a breeze.

First, navigate to the video on Youtube

and click the three-dot icon
just below the player

in the bottom right.

Select “Open Transcript”
from the drop-down menu

and a list of the video's captions will appear.

Remove the timestamps by clicking on

the three-dot icon
in the transcript toolbar,

and selecting “toggle timestamps”.

highlight all the text,
and copy and paste it into a document.

Add in important visual information where needed.

You can group lines together
by speaker if you like,

but it won’t make a difference

for people needing to access your content
using screen readers.

Its important to remember

that not all documents with text
are accessible.

Most PDFs, for instance,
“flatten” text into the document,

making it invisible to assistive screen readers.

So it’s best to save your transcript
as plain text

in a file type like .doc , .txt, or html.

After you’ve saved your transcript,

include a link to it
in your share text or on your website.

If you share your video on social media,

paste the transcript text
as the first comment on your post

so that users don’t have to click
to another page to access it.

Our goal here is accessibility,
and accessibility is cool.
