[NARRATOR]: Transcripts in a snap.

00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,620
Think of a transcript as a
text version of your video.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,629
When made correctly,

5
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,860
video transcripts can
be read by screen readers

6
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,959
or turned into Braille documents,

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,360
making your content accessible
to people who are blind or low vision.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,480
If a video player doesn’t support captions,

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,272
a transcript can provide access

10
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:20,220
for people who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing.

11
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,220
They're also helpful for people who

12
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,259
want to quickly scan
or search a video’s content.

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,920
So what’s in a transcript?

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,140
A basic transcript

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,000
is just a written version
of everything said in your video.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,740
It also indicates who says it,

17
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,160
and any relevant sounds.

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,669

19
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,440
To make our transcripts more accessible,

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,460
make sure to include

21
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,060
any key visual information
someone would need

22
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,120
in order to understand
what’s going on,

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,730
such as locations or
important nonverbal communication.

24
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,959
How else would someone
relying on a transcript know

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,080
that your characters were
waving from a train?

26
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,800
[train whistle]

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,459
Many service providers will
transcribe your video for you

28
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,179
for less than a dollar a minute.

29
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,840
But if you’ve already done the work
to caption your video on youtube,

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,389
producing a video transcript
is a breeze.

31
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:04,500
First, navigate to the video on Youtube

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,070
and click the three-dot icon
just below the player

33
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,279
in the bottom right.

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,940
Select “Open Transcript”
from the drop-down menu

35
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,509
and a list of the video's captions will appear.

36
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:15,060
Remove the timestamps by clicking on

37
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,520
the three-dot icon
in the transcript toolbar,

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,630
and selecting “toggle timestamps”.

39
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,979
highlight all the text,
and copy and paste it into a document.

40
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,300
Add in important visual information where needed.

41
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,660
You can group lines together
by speaker if you like,

42
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,840
but it won’t make a difference

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,760
for people needing to access your content
using screen readers.

44
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,800
Its important to remember

45
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,520
that not all documents with text
are accessible.

46
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,660
Most PDFs, for instance,
“flatten” text into the document,

47
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,420
making it invisible to assistive screen readers.

48
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,960
So it’s best to save your transcript
as plain text

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,440
in a file type like .doc , .txt, or html.

50
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,860
After you’ve saved your transcript,

51
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,100
include a link to it
in your share text or on your website.

52
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,860
If you share your video on social media,

53
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,700
paste the transcript text
as the first comment on your post

54
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,079
so that users don’t have to click
to another page to access it.

55
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,679
Our goal here is accessibility,
and accessibility is cool.
